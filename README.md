# SpamPrevention
Two different methods for dealing with incoming spam in regards to contact
forms.

## Description
Method 1: [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) is a service used for sending emails from a static HTML page 
without having a supported backend.
    > _gotcha: "Honeypot" used to avoid spam by fooling scrapers.
    The Formspree Github Repo can be found here: [Formspree
    Github](https://github.com/formspree/formspree)

Method 2: Mailto is a URI scheme indicating that a certain text is an email address.
An email client must be installed on the machine for this to work.
    >  Encryption techniques are used in an attempt to fool spam bots.

## Prerequisites
Most browsers support JavaScript, but the latest version of
[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) is highly
recommended.

# Usage
The email addresses used are sample emails. The emails need to be manually
changed for the purpose of self-testing. 

# Disclamer
Disclaimer: These methods are not 100% spam-proof.
